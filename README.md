## Why I Built This
I've always been fascinated by how systems break and how to fix them stronger. Cyber-Labs started as my personal scratchpad for ethical hacking practice during late nights grinding on CTFs. Now, it's evolving into a toolkit that mixes classic cyber tools with AI‚Äîthink spotting malware patterns that humans might miss. If you're a beginner like I was or a pro looking to collab, this is a spot to learn, test, and share without the fluff. No fancy production code yet, but real experiments that prove I can think like an attacker and defender.

## Key Features & Experiments
Here's what I'm working on‚Äîsome done, some brewing. Each one ties back to real skills in pentesting, defense, and AI integration.

- **CTF Write-Ups**: Step-by-step breakdowns of challenges I've cracked, with scripts and takeaways.
- **Vuln Scanners**: Custom Python tools using Nmap to hunt weaknesses in test environments.
- **AI Threat Detection**: Models (via scikit-learn) that classify network traffic as benign or sketchy‚Äîearly tests hit 85% accuracy on sample data.
- **Defense Scripts**: Logging setups and basic firewalls to simulate enterprise security.
- **Malware Analysis**: Dissecting samples safely with Wireshark captures and ML classifiers.

| Feature | Status | Tech Involved | Why It Matters |
|---------|--------|---------------|----------------|
| CTF Write-Ups | ‚úÖ Complete | Markdown, Bash | Builds problem-solving cred for interviews |
| Auto Scanners | üõ†Ô∏è In Progress | Python, Nmap | Shows automation skills for sec ops roles |
| AI Malware Classifier | ‚úÖ Prototype | PyTorch, Datasets | Proves AI-cyber fusion‚Äîhot for investors |
| Network Defense Tools | ‚¨ú Planned | Wireshark, iptables | Demonstrates real-world defense mindset |

## Getting Started
No heavy lifts here yet, but if you want to poke around:

1. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/CharlesKariuki-001/Cyber-Labs.git`
2. Install basics: `pip install -r requirements.txt` (coming soon‚ÄîNmap, scikit-learn, etc.)
3. Run a sample script: `python tools/vuln_scanner.py --target test.local` (ethical use only!)
4. Explore labs: Check out `/labs` for write-ups.

Pro tip: Set up a VM with Kali to test safely‚Äîdon't scan without permission.

## Repo Layout
- `labs/` : Guides and CTF breakdowns‚Äîstart here if you're new.
- `tools/` : Scripts for scanning and defense‚Äîsafe, commented code.
- `ai-security/` : Notebooks for ML threat models‚ÄîJupyter magic.
- `docs/` : Notes, diagrams, and reports‚Äîmy brain dumps.
- `assets/` : Images and extras for visuals.

## How to Contribute
Jump in! I love feedback from folks grinding in cyber.

- Fork it.
- Branch out: `git checkout -b my-fix-or-feature`
- Commit: Keep messages clear, like "Add Nmap wrapper for quick scans"
- PR: Explain what you changed and why.

Rule #1: Keep it ethical‚Äîno malicious code. Let's build up, not tear down.

## License
MIT‚Äîfree to use, tweak, and share. Just give a nod back.

## Heads Up: Disclaimer
This is all for learning and research. I'm not liable if you misuse it. Always get consent for testing, and remember: With great power comes great responsibility. If you're using this for job hunts or pitches, it's proof of my skills‚Äînot production-ready weapons.
